This project is a series of exercises that I created to practice Python while reinforcing mathematics concepts. The exercises cover topics such as algebra, calculus, trigonometry, and more. 

As part of the project, I also learned how to graph data and display it in a readable and understandable way using Latex. This combination of Python programming and mathematical visualization has helped deepen my understanding of both fields.

## Challenge

The most interesting challenge was learning the syntax of Latex and how it can be used to display mathematical data in an understandable way. Although it was initially complex, I found the process enjoyable and rewarding. I also learned a lot about Python libraries and how to ensure compatibility between different versions and packages.

## Outcome

These exercises helped me strengthen both my Python programming skills and my understanding of mathematics. It also taught me how to use Latex for mathematical notation and how to create clear, informative data visualizations. The project demonstrates my ability to combine technical programming skills with mathematical concepts to create useful educational tools.
