This project is a series of exercises that I created to practice Python while reinforcing mathematics concepts. The exercises cover topics such as algebra, calculus, trigonometry, and more. 

As part of the project, I also learned how to graph data and display it in a readable and understandable way using Latex. This combination of Python programming and mathematical visualization has helped deepen my understanding of both fields.
