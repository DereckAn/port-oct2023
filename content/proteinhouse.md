challenge: "The difficulties I faced when tackling this project were the implementation of the supabase api, and the implementation of user authentication, as I had no experience with these technologies, but thanks to the supabase documentation and the nextjs documentation I was able to implement them successfully. Also the downloading of the songs was a challenge since I didn't know how to do it."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to learn new technologies such as supabase, react-query, and nextjs. I was also able to improve my backend skills, and learn new techniques to download songs from youtube."

This was one of my first projects, created when I was beginning my journey in programming and web development. The purpose was to apply my learning in practice and challenge myself to design and deploy a web page using GitHub Pages.

The project served as a practical exercise in web development fundamentals and helped me understand the complete process of creating and deploying a website.
