This was one of my first projects, created when I was beginning my journey in programming and web development. The purpose was to apply my learning in practice and challenge myself to design and deploy a web page using GitHub Pages.

The project served as a practical exercise in web development fundamentals and helped me understand the complete process of creating and deploying a website.

## Challenge

As my first major web development project, I faced several challenges including:
- Learning and implementing responsive design principles
- Understanding and applying CSS animations effectively
- Managing project structure and organization
- Learning the deployment process with GitHub Pages
- Implementing clean and maintainable code practices

## Outcome

Successfully created and deployed my first portfolio website, which served as a valuable learning experience in web development. The project helped me:
- Gain practical experience with React and modern web technologies
- Understand the importance of responsive design
- Learn about deployment and hosting
- Develop problem-solving skills in web development
