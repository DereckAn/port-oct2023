challenge: "The difficulties I faced when tackling this project were the implementation of the supabase api, and the implementation of user authentication, as I had no experience with these technologies, but thanks to the supabase documentation and the nextjs documentation I was able to implement them successfully.Also the downloading of the songs was a challenge since I didn't know how to do it."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to learn new technologies such as supabase, react-query, and nextjs. I was also able to improve my backend skills, and learn new techniques to download songs from youtube."

Implement user authentication, and the possibility to create playlist, and add songs to the playlist, saving all the songs with their names, /images and url in the supabase database.
