This project was created with the intention of having a protein house page on the web, and at the same time learn to implement technologies such as nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, supabase, and react-query. 

Implement user authentication, and the possibility to create playlist, and add songs to the playlist, saving all the songs with their names, images and url in the supabase database.

## Challenge

The difficulties I faced when tackling this project were the implementation of the supabase api, and the implementation of user authentication, as I had no experience with these technologies, but thanks to the supabase documentation and the nextjs documentation I was able to implement them successfully. Also the downloading of the songs was a challenge since I didn't know how to do it.

## Outcome

Thanks to this project I was able to learn new technologies such as supabase, react-query, and nextjs. I was also able to improve my backend skills, and learn new techniques to download songs from youtube.
