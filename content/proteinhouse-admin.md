challenge: "The difficulties I faced when tackling this project were the implementation of the supabase api, and the implementation of user authentication, as I had no experience with these technologies, but thanks to the supabase documentation and the nextjs documentation I was able to implement them successfully. Also the downloading of the songs was a challenge since I didn't know how to do it."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to learn new technologies such as supabase, react-query, and nextjs. I was also able to improve my backend skills, and learn new techniques to download songs from youtube."
