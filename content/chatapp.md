challenge: "The main challenge I faced with this project was to use the Firebase API and to syncornize the messages in real time. Also, testing the application was another challenge, since I had to test it on two different devices, and I just have one emulator at that time."
outcome: "Successfully develop a fully functional chat application with real-time messaging capabilities."

Developed an interactive chat application using Flutter for the user interface and Firebase for real-time data management. I implemented user authentication, message storage and real-time updates using Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

I designed and built an intuitive and engaging user interface with Flutter that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The project demonstrates my ability to create full-featured mobile applications with modern tools and technologies.
