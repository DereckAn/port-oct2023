Developed an interactive chat application using Flutter for the user interface and Firebase for real-time data management. I implemented user authentication, message storage and real-time updates using Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

I designed and built an intuitive and engaging user interface with Flutter that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The project demonstrates my ability to create full-featured mobile applications with modern tools and technologies.

## Challenge

The main challenge I faced with this project was implementing the Firebase API and synchronizing messages in real time. Testing the application was another significant challenge, as I needed to test it on multiple devices but only had access to one emulator at the time.

## Outcome

Successfully developed a fully functional chat application with real-time messaging capabilities. The project helped me gain valuable experience in mobile development with Flutter and real-time database management with Firebase.
