This project came up because I need a way to create web components in a faster way and focus on other things. For this I was learning how to use the OpenAI API and how to send requests and receive information from the API.

My focus was to use the API but in the future I will take care of making the site more presentable and with more functionalities.

## Challenge

The main challenge was to fetch the data from GPT APIs and mold it to display it in a user friendly way. Also, trying to adapt the prompt was a little tricky because sometimes I did not get the desired result.

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates the integration of AI capabilities into web development workflows, creating a tool that can help developers speed up their component creation process. The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and additional features.
