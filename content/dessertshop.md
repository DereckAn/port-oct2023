This project is a personal project. It is a testament to my skills and competencies as a web developer. It was built using cutting-edge technologies such as NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript, demonstrating my proficiency in these tools and my ability to keep up with current trends in web development. 
The main goal of this project was to put into practice and demonstrate a variety of technical skills. Among them, Server Side Rendering (SSR), Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Responsive Design.`,

In addition, this project was intended to replace my old portfolio, which was developed with ReactJS. While ReactJS is a powerful tool in its own right, the decision to migrate to NextJS for this project represents my commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability, two essential qualities for any successful web developer.
In short, this project is not only a showcase of my technical skills, but also a representation of my passion for web development and my commitment to excellence in my work. I'm excited to share it with the world and hope it serves as an inspiring example for other emerging developers.
