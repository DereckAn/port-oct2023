A desktop application developed in Java for managing a dessert shop's operations. The system includes features for inventory management, order processing, and basic reporting capabilities. This project was developed as part of my academic coursework to demonstrate proficiency in Java programming and database management.

## Challenge

The main challenges included implementing a robust database structure that could handle various types of desserts and their ingredients, creating an intuitive user interface for staff members, and ensuring proper data validation throughout the application. Managing the relationship between orders, inventory, and customer data required careful planning and implementation.

## Outcome

Successfully created a functional desktop application that demonstrates solid understanding of Java programming principles, database management, and user interface design. The project helped strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming and database integration while providing practical experience in developing business applications.
