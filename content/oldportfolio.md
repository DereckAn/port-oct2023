challenge: "NextJS, being a framework with which I do not yet have a vast experience, presented several challenges during the development of this project. The management of server components and page optimization were undoubtedly the most significant hurdles I had to overcome. In addition, NextJS application path manipulation and dynamic page implementation were concepts that required considerable effort to fully grasp. Despite these challenges, I continued to learn and adapt throughout the process."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to put into practice my knowledge of web development, and also helped me to learn new technologies such as NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript. It also helped me to improve my design skills and learn new design techniques."

This was one of my first projects. I did it when I was starting to learn programming and web development. The purpose was to put into practice what I was learning and challenge myself to design a web page and deploy it on the internet using github pages.
