challenge: "NextJS, being a framework with which I do not yet have a vast experience, presented several challenges during the development of this project. The management of server components and page optimization were undoubtedly the most significant hurdles I had to overcome. In addition, NextJS application path manipulation and dynamic page implementation were concepts that required considerable effort to fully grasp. Despite these challenges, I continued to learn and adapt throughout the process."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to put into practice my knowledge of web development, and also helped me to learn new technologies such as NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript. It also helped me to improve my design skills and learn new design techniques."

This project is a testament to my skills and competencies as a web developer. It was built using cutting-edge technologies such as NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript, demonstrating my proficiency in these tools and my ability to keep up with current trends in web development.

The main goal of this project was to put into practice and demonstrate a variety of technical skills. Among them, Server Side Rendering (SSR), Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Responsive Design.

In addition, this project was intended to replace my old portfolio, which was developed with ReactJS. While ReactJS is a powerful tool in its own right, the decision to migrate to NextJS for this project represents my commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability, two essential qualities for any successful web developer.
