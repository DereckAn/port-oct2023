challenge: "The difficulties I faced when tackling this project were the implementation of the supabase api, and the implementation of user authentication, as I had no experience with these technologies, but thanks to the supabase documentation and the nextjs documentation I was able to implement them successfully. Also the downloading of the songs was a challenge since I didn't know how to do it."
outcome: "Thanks to this project I was able to learn new technologies such as supabase, react-query, and nextjs. I was also able to improve my backend skills, and learn new techniques to download songs from youtube."

This project was created with the intention of having a music player on the web, while learning to implement modern web technologies such as NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Supabase, and React-Query.

The application includes user authentication functionality and allows users to create playlists and add songs. All song information, including names, /images, and URLs, is stored in a Supabase database.
