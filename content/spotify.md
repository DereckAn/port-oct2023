This project was created with the intention of having a music player on the web, while learning to implement modern web technologies such as NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Supabase, and React-Query. 

The application includes user authentication functionality and allows users to create playlists and add songs. All song information, including names, images, and URLs, is stored in a Supabase database.

## Challenge

The main challenges included implementing the Supabase API and user authentication system, as these were new technologies for me. However, through careful study of the documentation for both Supabase and NextJS, I was able to successfully implement these features. Another significant challenge was developing an efficient system for downloading songs from YouTube.

## Outcome

Through this project, I gained valuable experience with modern web technologies including Supabase, React-Query, and NextJS. It significantly improved my backend development skills and taught me new techniques for handling media content in web applications.
