This project was created to practice my React skills and challenge myself to complete a full landing page in record time. I gave myself just three days to finish this page, focusing on creating a responsive design with a professional look.

To meet the tight deadline, I utilized pre-built components from Syncfusion, which helped accelerate the development process while maintaining high quality standards.
